# Project Title: SVG Editor

### Statement
The goal of this project is to implement XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics specification on a limited basis and to provide means to edit svg documents graphically.

### Analysis
The project will make use of several concepts.

* **Recursion**
  * Recursive HOPs, such as map and filter, will be used to retrieve data from the lists populated with "elements" displayed on the     screen.
* **State modification and object-orientation**
  * Objects will be used to store individual "elements" data and properties. Each object's state will be modified to adjust/update properties.

### Data set or other source materials
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload it from a website? access it in a database? create it in a simulation you will build....)

How will you convert that data into a form usable for your project?  

Do your homework here: if you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materails, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
The deliverable will be a GUI application with minimalistic toolset and a canvas, where primitive objects, such as lines, squares and circles will be placed. The application will allow to store canvas drawing in form of SVG document, and be able to render SVG documents
created with it (due to limited nature of implementation, most SVG documents created with other editors will be only partially compatible or incompatible at all). There will be an option available to modify each element on the screen individually via properties dialog.

### Evaluation of Results
If an application will be able to store and render the same SVG document without distortions/errors, this would indicate a scuccess.

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
What additionally will be done in the last chunk of time?

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

**Additional instructions for teams of three:** 
* Remember that you must have prior written permission to work in groups of three (specifically, an approved `FP3` team declaration submission).
* The team must nominate a lead. This person is primarily responsible for code integration. This work may be shared, but the team lead has default responsibility.
* The team lead has full partner implementation responsibilities also.
* Identify who is team lead.

In the headings below, replace the silly names and GitHub handles with your actual ones.
